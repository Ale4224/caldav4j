# CalDAV4j Overview

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/caldav4j/caldav4j.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/caldav4j/caldav4j)

CalDAV4j is a java library implementing the CalDAV protocol for the client side implementation.

CalDAV4j makes it easy to issue complex queries to a caldav server, supporting free-busy and calendar-collections. Moreover, it supports the standard adding and removal of events.

CalDAV4j used to have a version extends the Android Calendar App with Caldav Sync implementation for Android.

# CalDAV4j

## Goals

 - A high level API to work with CalDAV: This API works at the level of iCal4j objects, and allows for high level operations. All the "hard" protocol work that you need to do to make this happen is hidden from the end user.

 - A flexible query language support: An easy and flexible query language (eg. for events in a given date range); and Recurring event management (eg. updating master events and recurrence instances).

 - Low Level API Access: Let's you work at the Http/WebDAV/CalDAV protocol level by creating instances of HttpMethods (like GetMethod, MkCalendar, ReportMethod) and executing them.

 - Performance: When possible, caches (such as caches of etags and icalendar resources) are maintained so that network chatter and parsing of icalender files is minimized.

 - Compliance: We aim to be compliant with the following specs:
   * CalDAV spec and updates. ([RFC 4791](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4791), [RFC 7809](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7809))
   * CalDAV Scheduling specs. (Work in Progress, [RFC 6638](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6638))
   * Reliability: Many functional tests and the "rails" for checking your caldav implementation support.

# Using

CalDav4j is currently on Maven Central, thus to add it, you can add a dependancy by adding the following to the `pom.xml`:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.caldav4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>caldav4j</artifactId>
    <version>0.9.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Gradle:

```
compile 'com.github.caldav4j:caldav4j:0.9.1'
```

The unit tests are the best place right now to see how to use CalDAV4j. Tutorials and more documentation are forthcoming.

# Building

CalDAV4j uses Maven as its build system. To build this project, one must simply install through maven, while skipping all the tests:

```
mvn install -DskipTests
```

# Testing

During package creation, you can test your caldav server replacing the `caldav4jUri` with your own custom one.

```
mvn package -Dcaldav4jUri='https//user:password@hostname.fqdn.com/base/user/collections/'
```

A Docker image of a caldav server, Bedework (~900MB) is distributed via Docker Hub:

```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 ioggstream/bedework
mvn clean package -Dcaldav4jUri='http//vbede:bedework@localhost:8080/ucaldav/user/vbede/'
```
