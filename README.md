#CalDAV4j Overview

CalDAV4j is a java library implementing the CalDAV protocol. 

It makes easy to issue complex queries to a caldav server, supporting free-busy and calendar-collections. Moreover supports the standard add/remove of events.
CalDAV4j extends the Android Calendar App with Caldav Sync implementation for Android.

While we're moving to jackrabbit, CalDAV4j is still based on Slide project's WebDAV client library (which itself is an extension of the Apache's HttpClient library) to allow high level manipulation of CalDAV calendar collections as well as lower level CalDAV protocol interactions.

## Goals

A high level API: This API works at the level of ical4j objects, and allows for high level operations. All the "hard" protocol work that you need to do to make this happen is hidden from the end user. Supports:

an easy and flexible query language (eg. for events in a given date range);
recurring event management (eg. updating master events and recurrence instances);
A lower level protocol API: Let's you work at the Http/WebDAV/CalDAV protocol level by creating instances of HttpMethods (like GetMethod, MkCalendar, ReportMethod) and executing them.

Performance: When possible caches (such as caches of etags and icalendar resources) are maintained so that network chatter and parsing of icalender files is minimized.

Compliance: We aim to be implement the following specs

  * CalDAV spec and updates
  * WebDAV tickets spec
  * Caldav Scheduling specs
  * Reliability: a lot of functional tests and the "rails" for checking your caldav implementation support.

# Testing

You can test your caldav server replacing the `caldav4jUri` with your one.

```
mvn package -Dcaldav4jUri='https//user:password@hostname.fqdn.com/base/user/collections/'
```

A docker image of a caldav server ~900MB is distributed via docker hub:

```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 ioggstream/bedework
mvn clean package -Dcaldav4jUri='http//vbede:bedework@localhost:8080/ucaldav/user/vbede/'
```

# Building

CalDAV4j uses Maven as its build system. Here is some more information on building CalDAV4j
 

# Using

Download the latest JAR file and make sure it's in your classpath. The unit tests are the best place right now to see how to use CalDAV4j. Tutorials and more documentation are forthcoming.

# What's Next

jackrabbit support
android resource bundle
scheduling support
The roadmap will be updated as things flesh out more.
